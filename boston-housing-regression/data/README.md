# Boston Housing Dataset

The Boston Housing dataset is a well-known dataset used for regression tasks in machine learning. It contains information about various attributes of houses in Boston and their corresponding median values.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B**: \(1000(Bk - 0.63)^2\) where \(Bk\) is the proportion of Black residents by town
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status of the population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)

## Source

The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is often included in various machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-learn.

## Usage

This dataset will be used in the project to demonstrate data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using both Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
